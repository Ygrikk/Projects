## Introduction
This salary dashboard was created as part of my learning journey through [Luke Barousse's Excel course.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCJ15nGFgVg&t) The goal was to explore and visualize salary trends across data-related roles. The dataset includes job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills—providing a practical foundation for understanding how to analyze and present such information effectively.

### Dashboard File
My final dashboard is in [Data_Science_Salary_Dashboard.xlsx](./Data_Science_Salary_Dashboard.xlsx)

### Excel Skills Used
The following Excel skills were utilized for analysis:
- 📉 **Charts**
- 🧮 **Formulas and Functions**
- ❎ **Data Validation**

### Data Jobs Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains real-world data science job information from 2023. The dataset is available via [Luke's course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCJ15nGFgVg&t), which provides a foundation for analyzing data using Excel. It includes detailed information on:
- 👨‍💼 **Job titles**

### 🧮 Formulas and Functions
#### 💰 Median Salary by Job Titles

<pre lang="markdown">=MEDIAN(
IF(

    (jobs[salary_year_avg]<>0),
    jobs[salary_year_avg]
)
) 
</pre>

- 🔍 **Multi-Criteria Filtering:** Checks job title, country, schedule type, and excludes blank salaries.

- 🎯 User input is restricted to predefined, validated schedule types
- 🚫 Incorrect or inconsistent entries are prevented
- 👥 Overall usability of the dashboard is enhanced

## Conclusion
I built this dashboard to apply the skills I gained in [Luke’s Excel course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCJ15nGFgVg&t) and to better understand salary trends in the data job market from 2023. It helps reveal how factors like job title and location impact compensation. This project not only sharpened my data analysis abilities but also offered valuable insights for anyone navigating a career in data.
